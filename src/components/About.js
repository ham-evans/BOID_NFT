                    <p>Boids are a collection of 2000 algorithmically generated NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. With different colors, features, and movement patterns, all boids are one of a kind. </p>
                    <p>The entire BOIDS project was designed and developed by one person.  In purchasing a boid, you not only get a piece of emergent art, but you also get exclusive access to other projects in the works by the same developer.</p>
