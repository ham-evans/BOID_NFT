                    <p>BOIDS are a collection of 2000 algorithmically generated NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. With different colors, features, and movement patterns, all BOIDS are one of a kind.</p>
                    <p>After learning about emergence, a phenomenon in which the outcome is more than the sum of its parts, the developer of BOIDS took emergence to the blockchain creating an artistic NFT rendition of Boidâ€™s algorithm. In purchasing a boid, you not only own a piece of emergent art, but also receive exclusive access to upcoming projects from the same developer.</p>
