                    <p>BOIDS are a collection of 2000 algorithmically generated NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. With different colors, features, and movement patterns, each BOID is one of a kind.</p>
                    <p>In purchasing a boid, you receive a 20 second video stored on IPFS and are granted membership to the BOIDS community.  In owning a BOID, an artistic rendition of Boidâ€™s algorithm, you not only own a piece of emergent art, but also receive exclusive access to upcoming projects from the same, solo developer.</p>
